# Solution 
Normal characters (the ascii characters): reverse mapping (easy). 

Special characters: Brute force for every ascii character -> encrypt using public key e and N (we are given N at that specific index) then compare ***only the first 20*** characters of the numbers, if match then take.
### Intended solution:
Somewhere on github
