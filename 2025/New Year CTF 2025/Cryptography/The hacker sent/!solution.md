Putting this in Dcode identify shows that this is l33t speak <br>

Returns: "YOU_CO_ON_FAR_A_NAY_AT_CRYPTO", which looks promising (putting as flag didn't work)

Have suspicion that the tool decoded l33t code wrong, tried to fix: <br>
you , ***go*** , on , far , a , ***way*** , at , crypto <br>
YOU_GO_ON_FAR_A_WAY_AT_CRYPTO <br>

Inputting this as flag worked. <br>

`grodno{YOU_GO_ON_FAR_A_WAY_AT_CRYPTO}`
